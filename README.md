## AI Disclosure

I find it important to be transparent that frontend isnt my specialty and is activly a learning point for me. To help me better understand topics I've aided the use of AI to correct mistakes, however active development is being done by myself with as minimal intervention as possible from AI tools (Cursor, Copilot) when possible. Im treating this more as a tool to learn for learning frontend thatn just quickly putting things together. If you find things you think could be improved I'm happy to hear about fixing code and learning best practices, thanks!
